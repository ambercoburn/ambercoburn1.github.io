	<h1>Web Hosts Research Assignment</h1>
	<p>Amber Coburn</p>
	
	<h2><a href="http://bluehost.com" target="_new" title="bluehost">Bluehost</a></h2>
	<p>Bluehost is described as having the best uptime at 99.99%, fast load time at 0.41ms, and a cheap intro cost at $2.75 per month. 
	Additionally, it is easy to use and signup for. 
	Fast support and a 30-day money back gurantee make it a top web host. 
	However, one down fall is there is no free site mirgration. One cannot transfer their existing 
website to their hosting environment.	</p>
	
	<h3><a href="http://hostgator.com" target="_new" title="hostgator">HostGator</a></h3>
	<p>Hostgator is popular because it has the most unlimited hosting. 
	People are able to have unlimited email accounts and free site migration.
	Additionally, the uptime is 99.98% and load time is 0.43ms. 
	The downfall is a higher renewal cost at $2.99 per month and after the first 6 months it increases to $9.95 per month minimum. </p>
	
	<h4><a href="http://hostinger.com" target="_new" title="hostinger"> Hostinger</a></h4>
	<p>Hostinger is considered the cheapest web hosting at $0.80 per month. People are allowed one free domain name for a year.
	The load time is 0.37ms and uptime is slower than the two listed above at 99.91%. There is a 30 day money back gurantee, as the price can increase with the more you add on.</p>
	
	<h5>Top Host</h5>
	<p> If I had to pick a top host I would go with blue host because I think it is the most user friendly for building new websites. 
	It has a website builder for beginners, a good price for what is included, and if I do not like it I can get my money back before 30 days.
